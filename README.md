# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main problem we were solving in this course was deciding what data structure would be best to use for holding, sorting, and printing out the data collected for the course data. Using project 1 as the pseudocode and runtime, project two was to create the code based on the chosen data structure on the pseudocode.

How did you approach the problem?
The main way we approached the problem was to write pseudocode for each data structure considering vector, hash table, and binary search tree. After the pseudocode, we evaluated the runtime between the different data structures to help decide which data structure would be the best to use based on the data and program demand. Vectors for faster addition and overall search, I would choose hash tables or a binary search tree, if you need to search more specific course data, it would be faster.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Some of the problems I faced in these projects were creating a good way to hold prerequisites, originally I chose to create an empty list, but after feedback from my instructor, I changed prerequisites to become an empty vector. Other resources to overcome coding challenges at the beginning of the course, Stack Overflow was recommended to use when facing the hard coding challenge initially. The looping process was not working in my code; I had some created variables that were missing when splitting the list into tokens to add to my chosen vector structure. Along with using Zybooks to make sure I am implementing the vector sort and insert correctly. Though I believe I did a good job, I think there is still room for improvement.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on these projects has taught me to use more research data to find the best fit for software when structuring, look at the needs of the software from all angles, decide which parts of the software are the most important when deciding the structure to use, and how to implement the structure. It is best to break down the needs into charts, then create pseudocode to cover the needs. When writing the code, use well-placed comments to explain or show what the part is doing, or what the function is there for. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project, I understand better as to why having clear and insightful comments throughout the program that add detail as to what that line of code is needed for. Along with making sure I could have reusable code throughout, creating the code quicker and sufficient, making the code adaptable to different functions. Understanding how to create ways to handle errors, or future errors, or collisions within the code.
